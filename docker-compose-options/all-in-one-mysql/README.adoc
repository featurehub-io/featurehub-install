= MySQL All-In-One

This is an example of  the full stack in a MySQL container for demo purposes. It is not expected you would
run like this in production, but if MySQL/MariaDB is your flavour of database, this is what you would choose.

Please note that MySQL is a tier-2 "support" option. We test against Postgres and H2 on a day-to-day basis and
rely on the user community for failure feedback.
