= Google PubSub and FeatureHub Party Server

Google PubSub is considered production ready, this is a deployment of all components
separately.

This sample deploys Party Server running against the Google PubSub emulator. The stack will create the necessary topics and subscriptions on start, in "real mode" it would expect topics and one subscription to be created. It needs to create a new subscription for each Dacha2 and Edge instance because Google PubSub is not... PubSub.

All configuration is done by environment variables.

Stack:

- Party Server Instance
- Google PubSub
- Postgres database
