This repository contains the following FeatureHub installation assets:

- Docker-compose deployment options

All deployment options are pointing to the "latest" tag of the Docker images that we push to the https://hub.docker.com/u/featurehub[DockerHub]

You can find the "latest" release notes and previous releases https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/releases[here]

NOTE: From version FeatureHub v1.3.4 and later the containers are run in "non-root users" mode for security reasons.
